\section*{Introduction} In this document, we will present various mathematical results, such as 
theorems, lemmas, definitions, and corollaries, all properly numbered. 
\section{Theorems, Definitions, Lemmas, and Corollaries}  
\subsection*{Theorem Example} \begin{theorem} 
If \( a \) and \( b \) are two real numbers, then their sum is commutative, i.e.,  
\[ a + b = b + a. \] 
\end{theorem}  
\subsection*{Lemma Example}  
\begin{lemma}  
Let \( a \) and \( b \) be real numbers. If \( a + b = 0 \), then \( b = -a \).  
\end{lemma} 
\subsection*{Corollary Example}  
\begin{corollary} 
If \( a + b = 0 \) and \( a = 2 \), then \( b = -2 \).  
\end{corollary} 
\subsection*{Definition Example} 
\begin{definition}  
A number is called \textit{even} if it is divisible by 2. In other words, a number \( n \) is even if 
there exists an integer \( k \) such that  
\[ 
n = 2k. 
\]  
\end{definition}  
\section{Conclusion}  
This document demonstrates how to properly number and present theorems, lemmas, 
definitions, and corollaries in LaTeX using the `amsthm` package. You can easily refer to these 
results within your document, and LaTeX will handle the numbering automatically.
